# Critically-organized-forest-fires-in-South-America


• Conducted a geospatial data analysis with Python and explored the forest fires for South America in 2018.

• Processed the data using Pandas, Deepgraph, and visualized/animated results using Matplotlib, and Cartopy.

• Built ML models to study the spatio-temporal clustering of self-organized forest fires and predict their propagation.

• Identified the largest components and produced an animation for the temporal evolution of the largest component, 
   which takes place in the Galapagos islands.
